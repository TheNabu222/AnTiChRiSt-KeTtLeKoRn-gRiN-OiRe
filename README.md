This repository contains scripts and web apps for the Zettelkasten project.

## Running Tests

Python tests rely on **pytest** and cover utilities such as `parse_trunks.py`. Install the dependency and run:

```bash
pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest
```

JavaScript projects currently have no tests, but `npm test` is provided for consistency:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
