**Key Features**:
- **Interactive Knowledge Visualization**: SVG-based network graph of knowledge connections
- **Multiple Layout Algorithms**: Force-directed, hierarchical, circular, and grid layouts
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by relationship types, connection strength, and knowledge trunks
- **Cluster Detection**: Automatic grouping of related concepts with visual boundaries
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Generate insights about central nodes, patterns, and recommendations
- **Real-time Interaction**: Click nodes to navigate to entries, zoom, pan, and explore connections

**Components**:
- `CrossReferenceMatrix.tsx`: Main visualization component with SVG rendering
- `MatrixFilters.tsx`: Comprehensive filtering and layout controls
- `matrixAnalysis.ts`: Core algorithms for node generation, edge detection, and layout

**Analysis Features**:
- **Connection Discovery**: Automatic detection of relationships based on tags, themes, and explicit connections
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of emergent patterns and knowledge clusters
- **Centrality Analysis**: Ranking of most influential and connected concepts
- **Layout Algorithms**: Multiple visualization approaches for different exploration needs

### 3. Enhanced Navigation & Integration

**Updated Components**:
- `Header.tsx`: Added Chat and Matrix navigation buttons
- `App.tsx`: New routes for `/ai-chat` and `/matrix`
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Featured the new tools prominently in the interface

**Navigation Structure**:
```
Header Navigation:
├── Chat (AI Chat Interface)
├── Matrix (Cross-Reference Matrix)
├── Oracle (Existing Oracle System)
├── Terminal (Existing Terminal Graphics)
├── Tools (Advanced Tools Dropdown)
├── Google (Google Integration)
└── Insights (AI Insights)
```

2. **Multiple Modes**: Switch between exploration, analysis, synthesis, and creative modes
3. **Session Management**: Organize conversations by topic with persistent storage
4. **Citation Navigation**: Click citations to jump directly to referenced knowledge entries
5. **Configurable Context**: Adjust how much context the AI uses for responses

### Matrix Exploration Experience
1. **Interactive Visualization**: Zoom, pan, and click to explore knowledge connections
2. **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time filtering by relationship types and strength
3. **Layout Flexibility**: Switch between different visualization algorithms
4. **Cluster Insights**: Visual grouping shows emergent knowledge themes
5. **AI Analysis**: Generate insights about patterns and central concepts

## Integration with Existing Features
